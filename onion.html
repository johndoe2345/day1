		<p>LANGLEY, VA-A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.<br />

		According to the report, sections of the documents- "almost invariably the most crucial passages"-are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.

		CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:

					<li>the Cold War</li>
					<li>the civil-rights movement</li>
					<li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
				</ul>
